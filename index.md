## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pic.gif">
I'm a PhD student in Frank Hutter's [Machine Learning Lab](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) where I focus on meta-learning for efficient knowledge transfer and other automated machine learning-related topics. Previously, I joined the Stanford AI lab for my master's thesis to work in Jeannette Bohg's [IPRL group](http://iprl.stanford.edu) on graph neural networks and robotic manipulation. As a student research assistant, I also worked at Tamim Asfour's [H2T lab](http://h2t.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/index.php) with focus on cognitive robotics and robot perception. I hold a M. Sc. from KIT in CS/Machine Learning and am alumnus of the German National Academic Scholarship Foundation.
